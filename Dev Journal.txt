To-Do
=====
IMMEDIATE  >>
> Make sure there are no virtual fn calls in ctors/dtors
> Fix all destroyMenu calls made with submenu handles (DON'T CREATE A CONTAINER SUBMENU FOR MENU RESORUCES)

NOTE	---->
> Bundle muParserX's license with the source and binaries
> !!IMPORTANT!! Users of the lib need to link the runtime libs as a DLL to prevent inconsistencies across CRT states
> SAVE DEBUG SYMBOLS FOR EACH PUBLIC RELEASE
> Modifying the codascript global datastore during runtime will reset the state of backgrounded scripts


MISC	---->
> Credits:	T800G, for the window snapper code
	Ingo Berg, for muParserX (and for the great tech. support)
	CrashRpt devs; bundle the copyright notice and stuff


BGSEEBase		---->
> Reimplement the GetSecondsPassed command - Each execution context stores a counter that gets queried/modified by the command
> Redesign the plugin interop API such that all coda commands are stored in a pool before being registered to the VM
> Optional timestamps for console output
> Double right click on a form list combo box (TESComboBox) opens it for editing
> Update the plugin interface without breaking backward compatibility
> Move all Achivement related code to the client
> Replace CRT based assertion macro with a slightly more sophisticated one
> See if the aux viewport code can be moved into the lib
> A system to hotswap dialog layouts from custom resource files
> Look into the WS_EX_APPWINDOW style and its use to put owner windows in the task switcher
> Check if you can internally call SetWindowTheme to dynamically theme controls
