		> Render window gizmos
			> Imguizmo has issues with the CS' renderer (view matrix related)
		> Selection mask

			>> Would it be possible to have the option to view the list of NPCs, a sort of Use Info option just for NPCs who meet the conditions for speaking a response?
		> Copy From Template tool
			>> Batch editor for base forms
		> Add a random "roughness" factor to the landscape sculpting brush
		> Overhaul of the Region Editor, with a larger (adjustable?) window, a larger rendering area and greater control of node placement and repositioning.
