		>> ArkvedSpit1 spoke of the Reference Editor rotation fields, wanting these to only show positive numbers (something I've been meaning to request for years now). You replied saying you've fixed this, however I am still seeing negative numbers, and if I rotate in the render window itself and then open the Reference Editor window, the object can end up with negative rotation values even if they were positive before I touched the object. I have no idea what he/she is talking about when comparing to the vanilla Reference Editor window, it always showed negative numbers, and I cannot tell what buttons were requested to be restored.
		>> I agree that it would be nice to have restored the cut/copy/paste context menu options in the filter boxes without needing to use the keyboard.
		>> I'm sure someone must have requested this previously, but is there any way you can make the Render window display ALL 9 land textures in a single quad? The CS(E) only ever displays the first 8 textures, and then uses the land record's default texture in place of the 9th texture, though in-game all 9 are visible.
		>> Also, is that land texture quad window another fixed-size window, or can it be made a little bigger so none of the quad boxes require any scrolling?
		>> The lines in the land texture quad window don't correctly update themselves - if you add a new texture in the render window when the quad window is open, you then have to click on the line in the quad window which that texture would appear in to change it from a blank line to being populated with the new texture data.
		>> The Landscape Editing window lacks a visual marker to show when Vertex Shading is active. What would be really sensible (partly because I sometimes forget that the keyboard shortcut is Q so waste time pressing various keys and attempting to vertex paint before finding which key worked) would be a clickable toggle button to enable/disable Vertex Shading, which shows differently depending on whether active or not.

		> CSE INI preferences UI bug - exit confirmation message box is not showing up correctly/gets hidden under another window
		> CrashRpt doesn't handle any bounds-checked CRT funtion failures
			> https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/error/set_constraint_handler_s
		> Warn the user when attempting to load plugins with missing masters
			> Can cause UB/crashes
		> Selection mask does not work under certain lighting circumstances
			> Enhanced Econonmy.esp, EECell
		> Cell use list is broken
			> Forms instantiated with our custom serializers don't correctly update the cell count leading to negative values
			> Deleting a ref from the render window doesn't update its baseform's cell use counts (vanilla bug)

		> Dirty edits?
			>> http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1517431-rel-construction-set-extender/?p=25301452
			>> How do you stop the construction set from making automatic edits to an esp after saving it? Like for the unofficial oblivion patch, if I were to open in up in the CSE, do nothing, and save it, it will make loads of changes to region point list data under the region tab in TES4EDIT. For another file it automatically changes the "vertext height map" data under worldspaces for a bunch of landscapes.
			>> Can you reproduce this consistently? This is the first I've heard about this.
			>> Yes, I can. Not sure if I have something installed incorrectly or what but it'll happen everytime. Here's a gallery with some before/after screens after saving the unofficial oblivion patch and ooo shivering isles in the CSE and doing nothing else:
			   Also for other esps, I see under cell/lighting that Fog Near will be changed from 0.000000 to 0.000100. I think that one is done to prevent some kind of bug though?
			   Edit: did the same with ooo's esp and the unofficial shivering isles patch
			   For the vertext height map, it will always change the last 3 sets of values and nothing else from what i can see. no idea if that's important but i thought i'd mention it

		> Object window columns like Auto calc, Enchantment type, Count don't sort consistently
			>> Columns not handled by default = 3, 24, 41, 54. Some others are incorrectly handled


	ENHANCEMENT		=
		> Paste-in-place for Global paste
			> No, it just pastes them a certain distance in front of the camera, as a standard copy/paste would do. You actually wouldn't want it to do a global paste in place most of the time, it's something which needs to happen only when specified, as with the local paste in place.
		> Render window shortcut to toggle rotation/scaling in world/modelspace.
			> Add an indicator to the OSD's info overlay
		> Reimplement the hide active/deleted forms tool
		> An option to hide markers for thing such as Character placements on furniture as well as markers for effect like fire flies
		> OSD enhancements
			> Render window gizmos
				> Try this: https://github.com/BrutPitt/imGuIZMO.quat
				> Imguizmo has issues with the CS' renderer (view matrix related) (ask Nukem)

		> Add support for TOD/sunlight lighting in exteriors
			> Currently only works with interiors that behave like exteriors
				>> Seems likely that the issue is dependent on modifying the fragment shaders used for lighting in exteriors

		> Double click on formIds/editorIds in the console
		> Wildcard find/replace
		> Add an option to restore a saved backup for some esp/esm, instead of manually recover it from Data/Backup folder and moving it back to Data folder.
